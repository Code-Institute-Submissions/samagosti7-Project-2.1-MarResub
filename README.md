# Project Overview

A site on which to play the game rock, paper, scissors against the computer.  

Users are first taken to a home page explaining the site, offering a key for the game symbols, and inviting the user to give feedback. The user can then select the avaiable header links to the "play" and "feedback" pages to play the game or submit a feedback form. 

The site is free to use and mobile responsive.  

# User Experience Design

## Strategy

Designed for fans of the game, this site offers an online platform on which the player can test themselves against the computer. The running score is tallied and eventually a winner will be declared.  

It is also designed for users needing a simulation of the results of the game. Any user who needs to use chance determine a winner of some kind in a competition can simply obtain input from the competitor, and pit it against the computer.  

### Target Audience

This site is targeted towards users of any age with some knowledge of the game, looking to play versus the computer.  

## Scope

**Features**

- The site contains three pages, the Home page, Play page, and Feedback page. The header and footer are identical on all three of these pages. 
- Home page

- The header, at the top of any page, contains a nav bar inside a gradient background, with links to all three of the pages of the site.

- The footer, at the bottom of any page, containes icons representing four major social media platforms; Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. At the moment these links simply take the user to the landing pages for each of those platforms, as no social media exists for this site independently.

**Future Features**
- This site could add the lizard and spock choices to teh game to make it slightly more complex, and increase the variability of input and response.  
- Another possible addition would be to add a separate section offering a chance to pit the player against a second user.  

## Structure

The structure is quite simple, with three pages: index, play, and contact. 

## Skeleton

The wireframes below look quite a bit different from the end result of the site, due to a major pivot midway through the project.  Originally it was designed to be the game of battleship, as the wireframs reflect, but after complications the game design was amended. The feedback page was also added after the wireframing process.
